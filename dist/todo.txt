1. Front-end
Finish the suggestion list that looks like http://www.sectron.com/bg/product/20/evo192-kontrolen-panel-za-alarmeni-sistemi-digiplex-evo-s-192-zoni
Higher domain autority by creatimg on the details page link to the original webpage of the item or review
IF THE PRODUCT IS CURRENTLY GENERATED AND WE CLICK X FOR IMAGE JUST DELETE IT DONT SEND REQUEST!!!!
There is issue on IE-11. The contact folder blows up. Fix it!!!!!
There must be zoom over the zoomable details images

1.5 admin
Do the correct routing ( there will be probably errors )

2. Back-end
When we upload main image we must delete the unused main image file if it is not used anywhere else
When we delete product it is deleted from the cache but not from the db

3. DevOps
Enable HTTP2 and set certificate
Controll browser caching with headers

4. Optimisation 
The carousel must not contain so many products
Cache the response of the back-end for faster loading
Try to use AOT compilation ( currently angular use JIT )
Split the admin and the standart app to achieve faster page load ( it increase the size )

5. To be done ( move to category when list is empty )
Integrate dialog that shows the cart items each time you add new item
Think about better design over the app
Every product list must have description. It will raise our position in google by its 'Uniquenes'
Add orders screen to the admin
There must be no carousel on mobile
Everyone can upload images to our server.. its not ok !!!

6. Reported bugs
When you add image to already created file the image is not uploaded
