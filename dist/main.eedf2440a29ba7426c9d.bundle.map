If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = /*@__PURE__*/(function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _mdIconRegistry\n     */\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /**\n         * Screenreader label for the icon.\n         */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /**\n         * Color of the icon.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newColor\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} color\n     * @param {?} isAdd\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            if (isAdd) {\n                this._renderer.addClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color);\n            }\n            else {\n                this._renderer.removeClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color);\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

The arguments passed to this function are:\n * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n * projected inner Observable.\n * @method switchMap\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n}\nexports.switchMap = switchMap;\nvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n    }\n    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n    };\n    return SwitchMapOperator;\n}());\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n        this.index = 0;\n    }\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        var result;\n        var index = this.index++;\n        try {\n            result = this.project(value, index);\n        }\n        catch (error) {\n            this.destination.error(error);\n            return;\n        }\n        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (innerSubscription) {\n            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.closed) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n        this.remove(innerSub);\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n        if (this.isStopped) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n        if (this.resultSelector) {\n            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n        var result;\n        try {\n            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            this.destination.error(err);\n            return;\n        }\n        this.destination.next(result);\n    };\n    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 497 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

It can be used in the following ways:\n * - Specify the svgSrc input to load an SVG icon from a URL. The SVG content is directly inlined\n *   as a child of the <md-icon> component, so that CSS styles can easily be applied to it.\n *   The URL is loaded via an XMLHttpRequest, so it must be on the same domain as the page or its\n *   server must be configured to allow cross-domain requests.\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon svgSrc=\"assets/arrow.svg\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the\n *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of\n *   MdIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = /*@__PURE__*/(function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _mdIconRegistry\n     */\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /**\n         * Screenreader label for the icon.\n         */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /**\n         * Color of the icon.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newColor\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} color\n     * @param {?} isAdd\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            if (isAdd) {\n                this._renderer.addClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color);\n            }\n            else {\n                this._renderer.removeClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"mat-\" + color);\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

The arguments passed to this function are:\n * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n * projected inner Observable.\n * @method switchMap\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n}\nexports.switchMap = switchMap;\nvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n    }\n    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n    };\n    return SwitchMapOperator;\n}());\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n        this.index = 0;\n    }\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        var result;\n        var index = this.index++;\n        try {\n            result = this.project(value, index);\n        }\n        catch (error) {\n            this.destination.error(error);\n            return;\n        }\n        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (innerSubscription) {\n            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.closed) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n        this.remove(innerSub);\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n        if (this.isStopped) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n        if (this.resultSelector) {\n            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n        var result;\n        try {\n            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            this.destination.error(err);\n            return;\n        }\n        this.destination.next(result);\n    };\n    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/operator/switchMap.js\n// module id = 496\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
